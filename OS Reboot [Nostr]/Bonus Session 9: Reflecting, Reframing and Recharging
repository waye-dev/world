## **Bonus Session 9 – Reflecting, Reframing, Recharging**

The bonus “grand finale” gave the cohort a chance to look back on six months of OS Reboot and consider what the next six months could hold. With Noemi facilitating, the session centered on reflection, anchoring, and envisioning the future.

**Highlights**

- **Shifts in Perspective**
    - One participant came in skeptical of AI but left calling tools like Claude “so useful I hate it.” Instead of threatening craft, AI became a way to simplify development, reclaim focus, and view coding as creative again.
    - Others emphasized flexibility and acceptance: letting go of “how we’re supposed to be” and instead harnessing what actually works.
- **Anchors & Routines**
    - Participants shared the habits that keep them sharp: walking, blocking notifications, morning rituals, firm boundaries, and unapologetically protecting the conditions they need for their best work.
    - Anchoring practices were introduced — linking routines or cues to positive states for focus and resilience.
- **Community & Reflection**
    - Several noted that these calls were invaluable for reflection, pattern-spotting, and having a trusted group to test ideas with.
    - The friendships and accountability were just as important as the tools. *“I looked forward to these calls because I got to hang out with my friends,”* one participant reflected.
- **Big Questions**
    - Where do we land next as a species? Have we already passed peak screen time? How can AI expand human potential without hollowing out creativity? These questions surfaced as the group looked outward from their personal journeys.

**Takeaways**

- Attitudes toward AI shifted dramatically — from fear to seeing it as an ally.
- Reflection and community support were among the most valuable parts of the program.
- Boundaries and routines emerged as essential for sustainable creativity.
- Reboot gave participants not just tools, but momentum, clarity, and friendships that made those shifts stick.

**Closing Note**

The bonus session underscored that OS Reboot was never just about goals or frameworks — it was about building the resilience, clarity, and connections that allow open-source developers to thrive.

- **Impact**: Participants left more anchored, reflective, and connected.
- **Participant reflections**:
    - “I looked forward to these calls because it felt like hanging with friends.”
    - “The 10x anchor gave us a shared reason to be here.”
