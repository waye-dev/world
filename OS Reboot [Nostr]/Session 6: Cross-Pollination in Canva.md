## **Session 6 – Cross-Pollination in Canva**

This session broke format: instead of guided facilitation, participants used a shared Canva board to post, respond, and expand on each other’s 10x goals. The result was rapid-fire reflection, unexpected insights, and one of the liveliest debates yet: the role of AI in open-source work.

- **Highlights**
    - **Scaling Secure Messaging** → One participant’s 10x goal is making MLS messaging the Nostr standard while shipping a consumer-grade privacy app. With a new funded team of five, the challenge is coordination without heavy tools. Experiment: a new app built in five days almost entirely by an LLM.
    - **Skeptical of AI** → Another participant wrestled with AI coding, finding it draining and unproductive. Torn between hiring people or using LLMs, they worried it was “vibe coding” that risked control and craft.
    - **AI as Liberation** → In contrast, others argued AI is underhyped, a tool for creativity and human agency. One 10x goal: be more productive on under four hours of screen time by offloading to AI. Voice-based AI in particular felt like a game-changer.
    - **Purist Resistance** → Some admitted AI was “so useful I hate it.” They worried it stripped away the craft of coding they loved, preferring to use AI only for code review, not writing. Their 10x goal: stay in flow and avoid “cave mode” while finally shipping long-delayed projects.
    - **Protocols & Writing** → Another shared that their 10x depends on clarifying protocol needs. Instead of rushing specs, they’re considering writing a book to articulate the reasoning — treating writing as a foundation for future work.
- **Themes**
    - The group split on AI: shortcut to creativity vs. erosion of craft.
    - All agreed 10x required clarity, not just more code — whether through specs, books, or ruthless prioritization.
    - Flow and focus emerged as shared bottlenecks.
    - Tangibility matters: shipping, publishing, or simply posting became key milestones.

**Takeaways**

- Cross-pollination can be a great compliment to structured facilitation — fast iteration and debate pushed thinking forward.
- AI is both a tension and a catalyst: participants left questioning how to balance craft, control, and creativity.
- The 10x shift isn’t about working more — it’s about clarity, leverage, and flow.

**Impact**: Open debate showed how diverse perspectives sharpen thinking.

**Participant reflections**:

- “Hearing others’ takes on AI forced me to question my own assumptions.”
- “Cross-pollination gave me new energy and ideas.”
