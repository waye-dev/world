## **Session 2 – Breaking Barriers**

Building on the 10x goals named in Session 1, this session focused on the obstacles holding participants back — and how to reframe them as signals for growth rather than walls.

**Highlights**

- **10x goal sharing:** participants articulated ambitious goals — from mainstream adoption of freedom tech to building sustainable apps and exploring new creative mediums like book writing.
- **Naming the blocks:** common barriers surfaced — fear of judgment, unfinished projects, scope creep, scattered focus, and self-sabotage. Many resonated with the tension between wanting to “do it all” and needing to narrow in.
- **Reframing failure:** the group discussed how to strip drama from setbacks. Failure reframed as feedback keeps momentum alive.
- **2x vs 10x in practice:** linear growth meant more coding and more hours. True 10x shifts pointed toward leveraging AI, refining management, or designing systems that multiply output.

**Participant Reflections**

- One participant wrestled with the cognitive overhead of book writing, motivated by “wanting to read the book that doesn’t exist yet.”
- Another admitted to starting many things but rarely finishing — a habit they wanted to break to prove value and create traction.
- A third named perfectionism as a trap: goals kept expanding as scope creep crept in.

**Takeaways**

- **Limiting beliefs aren’t barriers, they’re clues** to where growth is needed.
- Clarity on a 10x goal comes not just from milestones, but from imagining true transformation.
- Perfection is subtraction, not addition — cutting scope, not endlessly adding more.

**Homework**

- Write down *all* the stories that surface while thinking about your 10x goal — both the inspiring and the shadow side.
- Bring them forward next session to reverse-engineer milestones and make the path concrete.

**Participant reflections**:

- “Naming the stories I tell myself was more useful than I expected.”
- “Failure isn’t a wall, it’s feedback.”
