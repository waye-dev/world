## **Session 1 – Values & 10x Goals**

The first session set the tone for OS Reboot [nostr] — clarity, accountability, and aiming far beyond linear growth. Participants committed to showing up honestly, testing the program as an experiment, and using feedback as fuel.

**Highlights**

- **Shared commitments:** privacy (Chatham House Rule), showing up fully, and giving straightforward feedback.
- **10x vs 2x mindset:** inspired by *10x Is Easier Than 2x*, the group explored how exponential growth is often easier than incremental improvements — it’s about shifting identity and focus, not just working harder.
- **Framing success:** participants named what “phenomenal accomplishment” would look like over the next few months — stretching beyond practicality into ambitious, energizing goals.
- **Accountability:** goals were encouraged to be shared (with peers or in 1:1s with facilitators) to create momentum and a north star for the months ahead.

**Participant Reflections**

- Some framed success as building user traction and real adoption.
- Others focused on shipping products, finding paying customers, or proving protocols in new contexts.
- A common thread: balancing ambition with the reality of blockers, scope creep, and self-sabotage.

**Takeaways**

- Feedback is the engine of growth.
- 10x goals reframe success as exciting and expansive, not just “more of the same.”
- Proof matters — success must be tangible, not vague.

**Homework**

- Define your **10x goal** and write down what *proof of success* looks like.
- Optionally: share with the group or schedule a 1:1 to refine it further.

**Impact:** The group left energized, aligned, and ready to think beyond incremental progress.

**Participant reflections**:

- “Motivation comes from clarity — writing the 10x goal made me realize what I really want.”
- “Accountability was key — I wanted to show up.”
