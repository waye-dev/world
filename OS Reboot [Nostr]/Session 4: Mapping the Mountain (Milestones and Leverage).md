## **Session 4 – Mapping the Mountain (Milestones & Leverage)**

With identity shifts from last session fresh in mind, this session focused on turning bold 10x goals into tangible paths. Using the metaphor of climbing a mountain, participants broke their goals into *base camps* (milestones), smaller steps, and leverage points.

- **Framing**: To reach the summit (10x goal), you don’t climb in one push — you move through base camps, each preparing you for the next.
- **Reflections & Insights**:
    - Some struggled with perfectionism: when is a project ready to “ship”? Feedback can feel distracting, but reframing it as fuel helped.
    - Others embraced leverage: asking *“who or what can help me go faster?”* shifted mindsets from hustle to smart resourcing.
    - Breaking down paths revealed both confidence (“I know what to do”) and bottlenecks (like management, prioritization, and contractor coordination).
- **Breakthroughs**:
    - Simplifying scope made goals more achievable.
    - Prioritization exercises revealed which tasks were truly leverage vs. busywork.
    - Peer encouragement nudged participants out of silos — posting, sharing, and collaborating more.
- **Exercise**: Visualize success at the summit, then “download” all the tasks, people, and resources along the way. Sort into milestones, then reorder by priority.
- **Themes**:
    - Perfection vs. progress: milestones are stepping stones, not endpoints.
    - Leverage over hustle: tapping into others, tools, or systems accelerates growth.
    - Feedback loops help break out of “cave mode” and sustain momentum.

**Homework for Next Session**:

- Reflect on management as leverage: what do you need most — processes, delegation, clearer communication, or accountability?
- Prepare questions/topics on management challenges to bring to Session 5.

**Impact**: Participants left with clear maps toward their 10x goals and a shared realization: progress depends not just on effort, but on leverage, collaboration, and rethinking how they work.

**Participant reflections**:

- “I saw how feedback isn’t a distraction but a way to go further.”
- “Milestones made the goal feel doable instead of impossible.”
