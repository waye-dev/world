## **Session 3 – Shedding the Old, Stepping Into the New**

This session focused on *identity shifts* — releasing what no longer serves and stepping into who we need to become to hit 10x goals.

- **Framing**: You can’t expect different results by showing up the same way. To reach 10x, you must shift identity, perspective, and habits.
- **Reflections & Shares**:
    - Some experimented with structure (2-week sprints, kanban boards, weekly announcements).
    - Others grappled with perfectionism, procrastination, or scope creep.
    - Breakthroughs included reframing “wasted time” as learning, finding accountability through daily journaling, and realizing feedback is fuel, not threat.
- **Themes**:
    - Sunsetting vs. sunrising — letting go of old patterns and embracing new ways of working.
    - Building in public, even imperfectly, creates trust and momentum.
    - 10x doesn’t have to sit on one person’s shoulders — leverage systems, automation, and community.

**Homework for Next Session**:

- Write down your *milestones* toward your 10x goal.
- Identify what you are sunsetting (stopping) and what you are sunrising (starting).
- Bring a draft list of milestones to the next session so we can map the path.

**Impact:** Participants began to embody new identities — shifting from “doing more” to “being different.” The group left clearer on what to let go of and how to align daily actions with bold goals.

**Participant reflections**:

- “It helped me accept iteration and stop hiding my work.”
- “I realized my old patterns weren’t going to get me to 10x.”
