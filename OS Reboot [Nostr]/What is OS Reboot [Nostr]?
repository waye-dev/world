## **OS Reboot [nostr] – Program Summary (Feb–Aug 2025)**

From February to August 2025, OS Reboot [nostr] guided a pioneering cohort of Nostr developers through nine sessions of reflection, experimentation, and growth. Designed and facilitated by Waye, with support from Noemi Boyer and Amiti Uttarwar, this was the first-ever Reboot cohort — and it not only shaped individual participants, it also helped co-create the foundation of the OS Reboot curriculum.

Over six months, participants explored the **10x vs 2x mindset**, surfaced barriers and limiting beliefs, practiced identity shifts, mapped big goals into milestones, and experimented with tools for focus, management, and rest. They tested frameworks like DMN vs TPN brain modes, and conscious rest — always grounding insights in the messy, real work of building open-source freedom tech.

By the end, participants reported **less burnout, more clarity, and better boundaries**. Some leaned into AI workflows, others into reflection routines, and all valued the peer network that emerged: *“I didn’t know what to expect, but it really anchored me.”*

## **Meet the facilitators:**  

**Noemi Boyer**

Meet Noemi Boyer - democracy's biggest fan and DemoLab's fearless leader. She's on a mission to shake up how Costa Rica and Latin America do democracy, one fired-up citizen at a time. Less dusty frameworks, more "let's get sh*t done."

Now she's bringing her magic to OS Reboot as our facilitator extraordinaire. After years of coaching entrepreneurs and navigating startup culture, she knows a thing or two about getting brilliant minds to play nice together.

In Noemi's sessions, expect zero snooze-worthy PowerPoints and all action. She'll help you turn those "wouldn't it be cool if..." moments into "holy cow, we actually did it!" victories. Because if there's one thing Noemi loves more than democracy, it's watching good ideas become great solutions.

**Amiti Uttarwar**

Amiti Uttarwar has been a bitcoin P2P protocol engineer since 2019. She's a mountaineer, meditator, and armchair philosopher. She’s coached and mentored over 20 full-time open-source devs, and is not slowing down anytime soon.

Amiti is on a mission to spark critical engagement around questions like how we work. Now, she’s bringing her passion, creativity, and sometimes-kinda-aggro truth seeking energy to OS Reboot, building a program that helps devs dev longer.

## **Impact at a Glance**

- **9 Session Facilitation** — group sessions and 1:1 coaching that pushed participants beyond their comfort zones.
- **Nostr developers leveled up** — gaining clarity, resilience, and collaboration skills tailored to the realities of building freedom tech.
- **Breakthrough practices adopted** — from AI-powered workflows and 10x goal-setting to reflective routines and conscious rest.
- **A trusted peer network forged** — honest feedback, accountability, and friendships that continue beyond the program.

**Takeaway:** OS Reboot [nostr] showed that when open-source developers are supported not just technically but psychosocially, they don’t just keep going — they accelerate, innovate, and set a new standard for what sustainable freedom tech looks like.
