## **Session 5 – Management as Leverage**

Building on last session’s milestone-mapping, this session tackled a tough yet important lever for impact: **management**. With Noemi away, the group checked in on progress and then dove into a workshop led by one of the participants with deep management experience.

- **Check-in**:
    - Participants shared how “leverage” had (or hadn’t) shown up in their work since Session 4.
    - Some found structure in two-week planning cycles and daily journals, while others noticed writing goals down once was more valuable than repeatedly reviewing them.
    - Takeaway: clarity and separation between *deciding* and *doing* helped prevent wasted time.
- **Workshop Highlights**:
    - **Management vs. Leadership** → both are required: repetition of mission, vision, and values alongside hands-on coordination.
    - **Hiring & Onboarding** → go fast, test quickly, trust intuition; expect the “J-curve” where productivity dips before rising.
    - **Training & Process** → use radical candor, set crystal-clear expectations, and create personal “checklist manifestos.”
    - **Leverage AI** → AI can act as a “rubber duck” for problem-solving and management reflection.
    - **Open Source Challenge** → unlike other industries, OSS lacks hiring networks and mentorship diversity, leaving devs isolated.
- **Themes from Feedback**:
    - Most had never experienced good management.
    - High interest in team structure, process design, and effective goal-setting strategies.

**Takeaways**:

- Management is a multiplier, not just overhead.
- Hiring well and setting expectations upfront saves enormous time downstream.
- Clear processes reduce burnout and make collaboration scalable.
- Even small steps — daily checklists, sharper goals, honest feedback — create leverage.

**Homework for Next Session**:

- Reflect on your own management edge: what’s the single biggest leverage point (delegation, process, communication, clarity) that could make your work easier?
- Bring management questions or examples to workshop further.

**Impact**: Many had never had a “good manager” — this gave them tools to avoid burnout and structure collaborations.

**Participant reflections**:

- “I didn’t think of management as leverage before. Now I do.”
- “It gave me language and checklists I can actually use.”
