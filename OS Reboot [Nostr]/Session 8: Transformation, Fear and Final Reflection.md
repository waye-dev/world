## **Session 8 – Transformation, Fear & Final Reflection**

The final scheduled Reboot session pulled together five months of work. With scheduling challenges and a smaller group, the tone was conversational yet full of insight. The focus: how real transformation happens, how fear holds us back, and what participants will carry forward.

- **Transformation Mechanics**
    - Change begins with *value assignment* — what the brain decides is important releases dopamine and sparks persistence.
    - Sustainable transformation requires shifting between **TPN (Task Positive Network)** and **DMN (Default Mode Network)**. Tools included: inserting pauses, sparking curiosity (“how does guilt serve me?”), and using visual cues to make priorities visible.
    - *“Apply it and repeat it”* became the mantra: awareness plus repetition builds new patterns.
- **Working With Fear**
    - Fear is vague by design — the amygdala keeps us in the familiar. To move past it, participants learned to:
        1. **Label it clearly** (e.g. fear of being seen, fear of losing people). Naming activates logic and regulation.
        2. **Rehearse it fully** — visualizing worst-case scenarios triggers emotional processing and lets the brain start rehearsing solutions.
    - As one participant put it, *“Do something that embarrasses you every day”* — a practice in dissolving fear through action.
- **Reflections on the Program**
    - Participants traced their arc: from defining 10x goals, to breaking barriers, shifting identity, mapping milestones, sharpening management skills, and exploring time and flow.
    - Five months in, shifts were clear:
        - **Framing**: the 2x vs 10x lens became a lasting anchor.
        - **Courage**: one participant took their first laptop-free trip in years.
        - **Leverage**: lessons on management and leadership reshaped approaches to collaboration.
        - **Reflection**: long-time solo workers said peer accountability was transformative. *“We can’t be what we need to be without other people.”*
- **Themes From the Conversation**
    - Flow states are powerful but resource-intensive; rest and conscious breaks matter.
    - Tasteful conflict and feedback loops are necessary, not optional, in sustainable open-source work.
    - Fear, reframed, can be fuel — clarity about what’s at stake drives courage and experimentation.

**Takeaways**

- Transformation = value assignment + awareness + repetition.
- Fear becomes manageable when it’s specified, rehearsed, and reframed.
- The 10x mindset reframes time, flow, and goals from scarcity into abundance.
- Community and accountability are not side benefits — they are the engine of sustained change.

**Impact**: Consolidated learnings into tools participants could keep.

**Participant reflections**:

- “The fear work was powerful — naming it gave me back control.”
- “This program helped me see myself differently, not just my work.”
