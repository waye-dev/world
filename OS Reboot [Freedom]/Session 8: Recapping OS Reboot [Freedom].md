# OS Reboot [Freedom] — Recapping OS Reboot [Freedom]

**Focus:** Revisiting and integrating tools from the past 7 sessions — breathwork, reframing, and experiments — and reflecting on long-term self-care as open source contributors.

**Key Insights**

- Breathwork and meditation practices resonated in different ways: box breathing and steady pacing helped calm nerves, while techniques like EFT tapping connected to embodied stress release.
- Participants reflected on past sessions with more nuance: burnout now seen as technical and measurable, shadow stressors reframed subtle daily habits like messy rooms, and reframing narratives shown to shift self-identity.
- The point of these practices: taking care of ourselves for the long haul, not just a quick stress fix.
- Transformation requires both clarity and acceptance — shallow shortcuts don’t work, but even small experiments reveal resistance and growth.

**Participant Experience**

- Guided meditation was suggested; reactions ranged from giggles to thumbs up, with curiosity about combining breathing beforehand as an amplifier.
- Everyone had tried body scan meditations before, with varying levels of comfort.
- Group reflections highlighted how concepts have landed:
    - Burnout reframed as a spectrum with clear signs and layers.
    - Shadow stressors identified in daily life (e.g., clutter adding “noise”).
    - North Stars as a mental reframe to catch negative narratives and flip them.
    - Acceptness and identity work in line with Rukmini’s session on the inner critic.
- Humor continued to play a role, but the deeper takeaways centered on identity, vigilance against creeping burnout, and the discipline of small, intentional shifts.

**Feedback**

- Participants found revisiting each session helpful to reinforce insights.
- The most helpful parts: practical breathing practices, concrete examples of reframes, and realizing that “messiness” — in rooms or minds — shapes identity.
- Areas for growth: finding ways to make experiments feel less overwhelming or “too much work.”
- The group continues to appreciate balance between serious self-reflection and moments of laughter.

**Homework**

- Revisit your **North Stars** — identify one negative inner narrative you’ve had recently and try reframing it into a positive identity statement.
- Choose one **shadow stressor** in your environment (physical or digital) and clear it this week.
- Practice a short **breathing technique** daily — experiment with box breathing or breath-plus-pause before exhale — and note how it impacts stress levels.
