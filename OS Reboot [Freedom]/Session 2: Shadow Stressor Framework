**Facilitator:** Debbie Johnstone

Ground rules emphasized confidentiality, respect, and full participation.

**Key Insights**

- Burnout is more than fatigue: it drains energy (physical), erodes patience (emotional), and clouds clarity (mental).
- Small, “ambient” stressors — clutter, guilt, noise, unclear priorities — chip away at wellbeing just as much as obvious deadlines or feedback.
- Stressors interact and amplify each other: work pressures spill into relationships, lack of feedback fuels perfectionism, and guilt blurs rest.

**The Shadow Stressor Framework**

Participants were introduced to a new tool for diagnosing burnout:

- **Specific External Stressors** → acute, visible pressures (e.g. deadlines, micromanagement, broken tools).
- **Ambient External Stressors** → low-level background drains (e.g. clutter, noise, poor light, inadequate routines).
- **Ambient Internal Stressors** → subtle, chronic self-pressures (e.g. guilt, negative self-talk, unclear priorities).
- **Specific Internal Stressors** → sharp personal reactions (e.g. perfectionism, over-indexing after harsh feedback).

The framework showed how stressors interact — for example: harsh feedback triggering perfectionism, or lack of feedback fueling guilt and spillover into personal relationships. Many participants realized for the first time how “ambient” issues quietly add up.

**Participant Experience**

- Contributors resonated strongly with the *Shadow Stressor framework* — many saw hidden stress patterns for the first time.
- Reflection exercises and group coaching surfaced personal rituals, blind spots, and concrete steps to reset.
- The mix of expert framing + peer sharing created powerful moments of recognition and validation.

**Feedback**

- Everyone found the session *helpful* — several said it was the first time they’d mapped burnout this way.
- Takeaways: “low-level things add up,” “ambient stressors are real,” “breaking stress down makes it manageable.”
- Most helpful: facilitator expertise, group reflections, stressor self-rating.
