# OS Reboot [Freedom] — The Window of Tolerance

**Focus:** Exploring the **Window of Tolerance** — how nervous system regulation impacts work, energy, and patterns — and identifying the beliefs and stories that keep contributors stuck.

### Key Insights

- **Transformation recap:** Last session emphasized that value assignment and belief fuel transformation. Micro-experiments showed that belief must come before action for sustainable change.
- **Window of Tolerance:**
    - *Hyperarousal* → stress hormones trigger urgency and short bursts of action, but modern life traps us here in chronic stress.
    - *Hypoarousal* → shutdown, fog, or disassociation when the system protects itself by conserving energy.
    - Sustainable performance means expanding this “window” through breathwork, bodywork, and reframing mental stories.
- **Mental stories:** Many noticed recurring beliefs like *“there’s not enough time,”* *“I’m not doing enough,”* or *“I’m behind.”* Instead of asking “is this true?”, the group practiced asking *“is this helping?”* — shifting rigid self-criticism into more regulating, reality-based narratives.

### Participant Experience

- The **icebreaker** surfaced shifts in perspective from the last three months — from slowing down without guilt, to reframing productivity, to realizing that answers aren’t “out there” but come from within.
- Contributors described how “full attention activities” were the only guilt-free ways they could disconnect from work — showing the tight link between focus, rest, and permission.
- Sharing practices like meditation, brag docs, and self-check-ins helped normalize that everyone wrestles with guilt, motivation, and self-expectation.
- The framework gave language for nervous system states participants had already been sensing but hadn’t clearly named — creating a sense of clarity and relief.

### Feedback Themes

- **Overall:** Every participant found the session useful.
- **Most helpful parts:**
    - Window of Tolerance explanation.
    - Icebreaker and group reflections.
    - Identifying hyper/hypo states in their own lives.
- **Takeaways:**
    - Extended dysregulation is what’s truly harmful.
    - Dysregulation isn’t always bad — short bursts can be useful if you can come back to baseline.
    - The “sweet spot” between sympathetic and parasympathetic states is where sustainable work lives.
- **Suggestions:**
    - A few participants asked for more slides or visuals to anchor the concepts.
    - Balance between discussion and teaching was generally praised, though a couple wanted slightly more structured teaching.

### Homework

- Practice clocking dysregulating beliefs in real time, and reframing them with *“is this helping?”*
- Experiment with regulating tools (breathwork, meditation, perspective shifts) when noticing hyper/hypo states.
