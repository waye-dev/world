# OS Reboot [Freedom] — North Star Framework

**Focus:** Moving from awareness → action. Building on burnout insights and stressor mapping, participants explored **North Stars** (personal anchors for direction) and began designing **micro-experiments** to test new habits and tools.

**Key Insights**

- Without a North Star, it’s easy to drift in circles. With one, progress feels grounded, even if the goal feels ambitious.
- The “Aware → Accept → Act” cycle resonated:
    - *Aware*: surface stressors and patterns.
    - *Accept*: embrace reality with compassion, not judgment.
    - *Act*: design small, testable changes.
- Focus time showed up as a double-edged sword — energizing when progress was visible, depleting when stuck. Logging small wins (including failed attempts) was seen as a way to break self-criticism and reframe what “progress” looks like.
- Freedom tech is a team sport — sustainability comes from collaboration, not just individual endurance.

**Participant Experience**

- Honest questions arose about whether it’s even possible to identify “tools” or “positive days” without more scaffolding — pointing to the need for clearer descriptions and examples.
- The **experiment design template** helped turn abstract goals into practical next steps: observe, hypothesize, test, and reflect.
- Some wrestled with whether their North Stars were too lofty — sparking valuable dialogue on balancing aspiration with attainability.

**Feedback**

- All participants found the session *helpful or thought-provoking*.
- Takeaways included:
    - The power of the *accept* phase — embracing reality with compassion.
    - A reminder that small micro-experiments can shift habits meaningfully.
    - North Stars provided clarity of direction.
    - Focus doesn’t always have to be draining.
- Most useful elements: group reflection, the North Star framework, the scientific experiment method, and the “aware–accept–act” cycle.
- No major concerns raised; a few noted they’re still processing.

**Homework**

- Commit to **micro-experiments** in the shared drive by June 19.
- Run experiments and collect reflections.
