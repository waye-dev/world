### Key Insights

- **Stress as a continuum:**
    - Relaxation zone (rarely sustained).
    - Tension zone (where most operate).
    - Red zone (fight/flight/freeze).
- **Burnout progression:** starts with enthusiasm → overwork → neglect of needs → withdrawal → unhealthy coping → collapse.
- **Body–mind connection:** Stress is physiological as much as mental. Techniques can regulate the nervous system and expand capacity to cope.
- **Resource vs. numbing:** A key distinction — regulation is about conscious choices, while numbing avoids feelings and drains resilience.

### Techniques Practiced

- **Physiological Sigh** → two nasal inhales, long exhale (Stanford method to quickly downshift stress).
- **Vagus Nerve Activation** → hand on forehead + back of neck to trigger parasympathetic response.
- **Self-Hug Technique** → one hand tucked under arm, other on opposite shoulder for grounding.
- **Box Breathing** → steady 4–4–4–4 rhythm for calm focus.

Participants also explored meditation, somatic grounding, gratitude, and daily habits (healthy eating, sleep, movement, boundaries).

### Participant Experience

- Sharing physical sensations of stress made it tangible: being chased, feeling trapped, muscle tension, stomach knots, loss of energy.
- Descriptions of burnout resonated widely: “more effort doesn’t work anymore,” “ruminant thinking,” “low motivation,” “burnout is a spectrum.”
- Group noted that awareness of subtle signs is critical — without prior knowledge, burnout can creep in unnoticed.
- Practicing the techniques in real time helped surface which felt natural and which felt forced.

### Feedback Themes

- **Overall:** Participants rated the session useful, with many planning to adopt at least one technique.
- **Most helpful parts:** Experiencing regulation tools live, understanding the stress–burnout continuum, group reflection.
- **Takeaways:**
    - Stress management must be embodied, not just cognitive.
    - Small practices (like breathwork) can shift state quickly.
    - Burnout isn’t binary — it builds gradually.
- **Suggestions:** A few wanted even more time for practice or deeper dives into each technique.

### Homework

- Choose one stress regulation technique and practice consistently until the next session.
- Notice the difference between numbing and regulating in daily choices.
- Reflect on which strategies already help and what new ones might add resilience.
