# OS Reboot [Freedom] — Draw Your Feelings

**Facilitator:** Rukmini Poddar

**Focus:** Meeting the **inner critic** — understanding how it shows up, mapping its patterns, and experimenting with reframing.

### Key Insights

- **The inner critic is universal.** Though expressed differently, everyone could relate — frustration, fear, self-doubt, or tension. The saying *“what is most personal is most universal”* resonated strongly.
- **Mapping the critic.** Using a “chain of reactions” framework, participants traced how a trigger sparks emotion, fuels critical self-talk, and leads to behaviors like avoidance, overwork, or spiraling. This process made invisible cycles more concrete.
- **Metaphors matter.** One analogy — holding a beachball under water — captured how suppressing the critic only makes it push back harder. Drawings of each other’s critics (a sloth, mythical creatures, limiting voices) brought levity and depth.
- **Reframing.** Instead of detachment or suppression, participants explored creating reframe statements: identifying what gives life, naming why they want to grow, and committing to do it *their way*.

### Participant Experience

- Breakouts paired contributors to map and share their critic’s patterns — sparking both vulnerability and laughter.
- Some found their critic quieter than usual, which led to reflection on whether that was true calm or avoidance.
- Sharing personal cycles (e.g., “not fast enough → fear/shame → avoidance”) surfaced common struggles in open source work — deadlines, coordination, public image, self-comparison.
- Creative exercises (drawing, reframing) helped externalize the critic, making it less overwhelming and more workable.

### Feedback Themes

- **Emotional safety:** Most felt safe; one noted only “kind of.”
- **Breakouts:** Largely appreciated as valuable, though one person was less certain.
- **Familiarity with the critic:** Mixed — some knew theirs well, others only somewhat.
- **Creative exercise:** Widely helpful — from “quite helpful” to “awesome.”
- **Takeaways:**
    - Reframing self-talk instead of suppressing it.
    - The beachball analogy for resistance.
    - Realizing how much daily self-talk is negative — and how universal that is.
- **Suggestions:** One participant suggested occasionally running longer (2-hour) sessions instead of 90 minutes for deeper processing.

### Homework

- Keep noticing the critic’s voice: when does it show up, and what pattern does it trigger?
- Practice reframing — not silencing — the critic into statements that support growth.
