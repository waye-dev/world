# **OS Reboot [Freedom] – Program Summary**

**(May–Sept 2025)**

Freedom Reboot is a guided cohort program for open source contributors working on freedom tech. Over nine weeks, participants step back from the grind and build practices that make their work more sustainable.

Through facilitated sessions, creative exercises, and peer connection, developers explore:

- Burnout and hidden “shadow stressors” that drain energy
- Defining and realigning with personal *North Stars*
- Small, testable experiments for new habits
- Neuroscience of focus, curiosity, and change
- Tools for regulating stress and meeting the inner critic

The result is a stronger foundation for clarity, resilience, and collaboration — so contributors can continue their work not just with endurance, but with energy and purpose.

## Meet the Facilitators:

**Amiti Uttarwar:** Bitcoin P2P protocol engineer since 2019. On a mission to uncover our human source code, just ask the dozens of OS devs she's coached.

**Debbie Johnstone:** 25 years as an HR leader is just the tip of the iceberg. Professional unlocker of human potential.

**Rukmini Poddar:** Artist, designer, educator and author of *'Draw your Feelings'*. Her creative passion lies at the intersection of emotional wellness and creative storytelling.

**Vanina Kala Waizmann:** Doctor of Psychology with specialized knowledge of burnout and nervous system regulation. Magical creature.

**Anna Sides:** Operational excellence that literally sent 100,000s of people camping. Her dogs are her personality.
