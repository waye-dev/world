## The 10x Framework

Stop optimizing the plane â€” **build the rocket ship.**
- Designed to shift you from incremental (2x) to exponential (10x) thinking.
- Helps you identify what actually moves the needle.
- Focuses on clarity over chaos, priorities over pressure.
- Encourages action from your future self, not just your overwhelmed present.
- Less grind, more leverage.
