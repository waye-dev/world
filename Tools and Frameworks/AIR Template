## Welcome! Let’s get started.

This is a tool to observe monthly patterns and trends, creating a feedback loop that naturally encourages deeper, more meaningful work. Use this tool at whatever cadence feels most effective—whether that’s monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly. Feel free to adjust as you go to fit your evolving needs.

## The Process:

1. **Copy the template below** into the place you work the best.  

2. **Fill it out at your own cadence.** We recommend at least once per month and be sure to keep an AIR log. Filling out your AIR could take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour. 

3. **Celebrate your wins, big and small.** Each achievement, no matter the size, is a meaningful step in your growth. Research shows that celebrating small wins reinforces positive habits by linking effort with reward.
