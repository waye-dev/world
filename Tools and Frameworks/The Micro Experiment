## Micro Experiment Template

This is your micro experiment — designed and led by you — to explore a small tool, habit, or daily ritual that could move you closer to your north star.

---

## Observation
**What’s something in your day-to-day that feels off, draining, or unproductive?**  
*(Example: “I scroll for 30 minutes before starting work.”)*

---

## Question
**What do you want to understand about this habit?**  
*(Example: “Why do I start the day with distractions instead of focus?”)*

---

## Research
**Think back to a time when you did this well. What helped it go well? Why didn’t it stick?**  
*(Example: “That week I journaled each morning, I felt grounded. But I stopped when work got chaotic.”)*

> Use this insight to guide your experiment.

---

## Hypothesize
**What’s a small change you think might help? Why?**  
*(Example: “If I don’t check my phone until after I write for 15 minutes, then I’ll focus better because I’ll start the day with intention rather than distraction.”)*

> A meaningful hypothesis is falsifiable. Try using the format:  
> **if [x] then [y] because [z]**

## Design Your Micro-Experiment
**What habit/tool/routine will you try for 1 week? Make it super doable.**  
*(Example: “Keep my phone in another room until after 15 mins of writing.”)*

- Start Date:  
- Observe & Reflect Date:  
- Frequency:  
- Duration:  
- Tools or Support Needed:

## Run the Micro-Experiment & Gather Data
**What data will you collect while running the experiment?**  
> Get really specific. Meaningful data will indicate whether your hypothesis is true or false.  

As you are running the experiment, also note down any additional indicators that you notice.  

---

## Observe & Reflect
On your observe & reflect date:

- What happened?  
- What worked? What didn’t?  
- How did it feel?  
- What could be better?  

---

## Iterate
**Will you keep, tweak, or toss this habit? Why?**  
*(Example: “Keep it — I felt more clear-headed in the mornings.”)*
