## 🏔️ Wayepoint call — Self-Audit 🏔️

This audit is here to help you pause, take stock, and reflect on where you’re at right now. Your responses will help identify where you're at. By understanding your patterns, motivations, and challenges, we will create a map to support you as an open source contributor.

We've included a bunch of prompts to spark reflection, but this space is yours. Make it useful. Add doodles, bullet points, long rants, screenshots — whatever helps you. The more honest and personal this is, the more powerful it’ll be (for you and for us).
