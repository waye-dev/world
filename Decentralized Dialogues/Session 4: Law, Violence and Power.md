## **Session 4 -** Law, Violence and Power

**Reading:** [Locke’s *Second Treatise of Government*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm) (paras. 1–51, 86–100, 119–158, 199, 211–243)

We moved from Hobbes to Locke, exploring how his more optimistic view of the state of nature shapes ideas of property, punishment, and governance — and what those mean for Bitcoin.

### **From Hobbes to Locke**

- **Hobbes:** the state of nature is chaos, requiring a sovereign with coercive power.
- **Locke:** the state of nature has order, grounded in natural law and reason. Cooperation is possible, though imperfect — and people enter government mainly to protect property.
- Where Hobbes saw inevitable war, Locke saw natural limits and rationality (e.g., take too many apples and let them rot, you’ve violated natural law).

### **Dialogue Threads**

- **Optimism vs realism:** Is Locke naive about cooperation? Game theory suggests self-interest keeps order, but today’s world feels less idealistic.
- **Punishment:** Locke allows proportional punishment, even lethal force against murderers — raising questions about self-defense, enforcement, and collective responsibility.
- **Property:** Ownership arises when labor is mixed with resources. Applied to Bitcoin:
    - Mining as labor → block rewards as property.
    - But does “labor” equal value? Demand determines value, not just effort.
    - Bitcoin protects property rights by making seizure or invalid blocks unprofitable.
- **Defects of nature:** Locke says the state of nature lacks three things: known law, impartial judges, and enforcement. Does Bitcoin suffer these defects — or solve them through consensus rules, math, and incentives?
- **Civil conflict:** The block size war resembled a civil war — intense but not fatal. Property wasn’t destroyed; rules were contested yet order survived. Does this make Bitcoin Hobbesian (survival through conflict) or Lockean (cooperation with safeguards)?
- **Violence and tyranny:** Locke permits resistance when government violates natural law. In Bitcoin, users can “exit” by running different software. Does this make Bitcoin more Lockean, with property protection at its core, or Hobbesian, with survival through power?

### **Reflections**

- Is Bitcoin itself a government, or an opt-in commonwealth?
- Does inflation violate natural property rights?
- If governments claim eminent domain over property, does that legitimize Bitcoin as a counter-power?
- Does Bitcoin offer rights *and* power — the ability to defend property without sovereign violence?
- When governments act unjustly, is returning to the “state of nature” preferable? Is Bitcoin that return, or something new?

### **Feedback highlights**

- Participants valued the contrast between Hobbes’ pessimism and Locke’s optimism.
- Property theory sparked the most engagement, especially when mapped onto mining and ownership in Bitcoin.
- The block size war analogy helped ground abstract theory in Bitcoin’s real history.
- Some suggested more time on Locke’s defects of nature → law, judge, enforcement — as a frame for Bitcoin governance.
- The blend of heavy philosophy and humor kept the session both serious and lively.
