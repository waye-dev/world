## **Session 2 -** Foundations of Governance and Justice

**Readings:** [Plato’s *Minos*](https://monadnock.net/plato/minos.html) and [Aristotle’s *Politics* (Book I)](https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.1.one.html)

We continued by grounding ourselves in dialogue, exploring how ideas of law, justice, and governance connect to Bitcoin. Attendance was strong, with most of the group present.

### **Plato’s Minos**

The discussion raised fundamental questions:

- Is authorship itself a function — as with Homer or Socrates — and could Bitcoin have a “Satoshi function”?
- Is law something natural we discover, or something constructed by humans? If “code is law,” does that mean code can also be *bad law*? If code is speech, what then?
- Do laws require being broken to be real? Who enforces them? Who suffers under them?
- One provocative claim: laws exist to control the poor — echoing the tension between justice as ideal and justice as power.

**Takeaways:**

- Bitcoin can be seen as a *corpus-forming mechanism* — a community authorship of code and rules that persist.
- If true law reflects “what is,” Bitcoin’s rules align with deeper truths: scarcity, proof-of-work, and finality. Where social laws are subjective, Bitcoin is neutral and consistent.
- Dramatic irony in Plato’s writing highlighted the difficulty of distinguishing between law as truth and law as habit.

### **Aristotle’s Politics**

From Aristotle came the sharp dichotomy: are we beasts or gods without law?

- Law should aim at the natural good, but who claims the privilege of knowing what that is?
- Does abuse of law nullify its proper use? Or does misuse coexist with truth?
- Aristotle’s notion of “natural slaves” clashed with Bitcoin’s openness. Bitcoin undermines hierarchies by allowing anyone with access to contribute, challenging the idea that law requires a political state. Here, *law enforces itself*.

### **Reflections & Questions**

- Can Bitcoin be considered a law discovered in reality, rather than a law invented by society?
- Is “code is law” a form of justice, or does it risk encoding injustice when bad code persists?
- Does Bitcoin destabilize traditional notions of rulers and ruled, creating a new form of governance without a state?
- What does it mean for law, justice, and code when communities — not authorities — decide what stays in the corpus?

### **Feedback highlights:**

- Participants appreciated tackling *Minos* and *Politics* together — it surfaced real contrasts between discovery vs. construction, natural order vs. human authority.
- Linking classical texts to Bitcoin helped make abstract philosophy concrete.
- Some noted the conversation moved quickly; more structure or grounding examples could help pace future discussions.
- People valued the blend of serious inquiry with moments of humor and camaraderie, which made dense texts more approachable.
