## **Session 3 -** The Right to Privacy

**Reading:** [Hobbes’ *Leviathan*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Leviathan/2yrgqz6mg5oC?hl=en&gbpv=1) (Dedication, Introduction, Ch. 13–21, 26, final paragraph of 31)

We dug into Hobbes’ political philosophy and its resonance with Bitcoin — sovereignty, contracts, natural law, and whether Bitcoin is a new kind of Leviathan or its opposite.

### **Hobbesian Principles in Question**

- Hobbes’ *state of nature* — life as “war of all against all” — was challenged. What if the natural state is harmony, not war? If his premise is wrong, does the rest collapse?
- Sovereignty: Hobbes gives unlimited power to the sovereign, but must sovereignty itself be above law?
- Contracts: for Hobbes, they’re meaningless without coercive power — promises bind only if backed by fear.
- Justice: “the interest of the stronger”? Are laws simply tools of control?

### **Dialogue Threads**

- **Natural vs artificial law:** Is there a divine element, or is reason itself the universal ground? Contracts require consequences — punishment, reputation, or faith in order.
- **Bitcoin parallels:**
    - *Don’t trust, verify* echoes Hobbes’ insistence that contracts without teeth aren’t real.
    - Bitcoin introduces consequences via math, not violence — reputation and proof replace coercion.
    - Is Bitcoin returning us to natural law (math as natural, provable)? Or inventing a new artificial order?
- **Trust and verification:** Open-source code requires faith in the community — not everyone audits everything. “Verify” partly means trusting that others are verifying what you can’t. Incentives are bets on the future, but the future is uncertain.
- **Sovereignty in Bitcoin:** Was Satoshi a sovereign when rolling back a bug? Or is sovereignty here replaced by rules themselves — reason embodied in code? Bitcoin could be read as the *ultimate anti-Leviathan* (power dispersed, no ruler) or as Leviathan reborn in code (rules absolute, binding all).

### **Reflections**

- Contracts collapse without consequences — so how do transactions and commitments in Bitcoin equate to contracts?
- Reputation and merit govern contributions in open-source, echoing Hobbes’ concern with enforcement.
- Sovereignty as “artificial soul”: does Bitcoin itself now play this role? A system of rules that binds without rulers.
- Invention vs discovery: is Bitcoin something humanity created, or something we uncovered about the nature of reason and order?
- Reason itself may be the only binding power left — Bitcoin as a rational system that holds authority without sovereign violence.

### **Closing Questions**

- Is Bitcoin offering the security and stability our sovereigns can no longer guarantee?
- Does it dissolve the Leviathan, or recreate it in mathematical form?
- Can reason — universal, but contested — serve as a foundation for law in a decentralized age?
