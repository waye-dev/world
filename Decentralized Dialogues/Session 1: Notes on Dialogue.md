## **Session 1 - Notes On Dialogue**

**Readings:** [Notes on Dialogue *Stringfellow Barr*](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/centers/boisi/pdf/f10/Notes_on_Dialogue.pdf)

We began with the long view: Bitcoin may shape the next few hundred years. To meet that scale, we opened this program with *Notes on Dialogue* — grounding ourselves in what good dialogue looks like so we can learn, and agree together, how to have it. This series is about exploring the deepest ideas, tackling dense texts collectively, and holding space for conflicting perspectives. No dogma, no persuasion — just dialogue.

**Opening questions surfaced:**

- How do we prevent Bitcoin from becoming just another “Bitcoin dollar”?
- Does Bitcoin restore trust, or eliminate the need for it?
- Should we be satisfied with Bitcoin’s progress so far, or expect more?
- What role might Bitcoin play in transitional justice or even nation-state building?
- How does dialogue itself mirror (or differ from) consensus in Bitcoin?

**Themes of dialogue:**

- The *mind’s ear*: conversations fail not because of what’s said, but because of how we listen.
- Dialogue ≠ persuasion; it’s *mining for truth* — abundant, not scarce.
- The mind’s eye is solitary; the mind’s ear is collective, decentralized.
- Dialogue has both light (connection, truth) and dark (ego defense, power struggles, danger) sides.
- Words matter: they can connect or wound, liberate or silence.
- Consensus isn’t the same as dialogue — code can be judged on merit, but words often lose context, creating noise.

**Reflections:**

Perhaps these questions have always been here, but only now are we listening with the *mind’s ear*. Dialogue asks us to risk ego for truth — and to recognize that timing, humility, and openness shape whether dialogue succeeds.

**Feedback highlights:**

- People valued starting with *Notes on Dialogue* as a shared foundation for how we’ll converse.
- The framing around the *mind’s ear* resonated strongly.
- The breadth of perspectives and questions made the session feel expansive.
- Texts are dense but rewarding — participants appreciated unpacking them together.
