## **Session 5 -** Sovereignty and the State of Exception

**Reading:** Carl Schmitt, [*Political Theology*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1psk3_wSODDlYXyr1Wv3om9yoZIDx-5ba/view?usp=sharing) (all four essays, pp. 5–66)

We explored Schmitt’s famous idea: *sovereign is he who decides on the exception.* Why the obsession with the “exception”? Because it reveals the limits of law — rules don’t enforce themselves, and moments of crisis expose who (or what) truly holds power.

### **Why the Exception Matters**

- Rules are only meaningful within a context — we judge rules by comparing them against other rules, but what about when rules no longer apply?
- Emergencies force judgment calls, and in those moments the sovereign is revealed.
- Natural law was invoked across perspectives: Hobbes, Locke, and Kant all saw it differently. Is natural law eternal, or just another human attempt to define limits?
- Law vs wisdom: abstract rules are always incomplete. To fill the gaps, we rely on judgment, power structures, or force.

### **Dialogue Threads**

- **Ideas vs people:** Is sovereignty about the “ultimate rule,” or about who decides when rules break? Schmitt rejects the fantasy of a perfect rulebook.
- **Law and theology:** The modern state mirrors theological concepts — sovereignty as will vs intellect, human law vs divine law.
- **The problem of incompleteness:** Like Gödel’s theorems or the halting problem, no rule system can anticipate every case. Exceptions are inevitable.
- **Guns and power:** At root, who controls the military (or enforcement) decides. But soldiers themselves have agency — sovereignty is always mediated by people.

### **Bitcoin Parallels**

- Is there an “exception” in Bitcoin? Examples raised: the inflation bug, or a future quantum hard fork. These are crises where rules might fail and judgment steps in.
- In fiat systems, sovereigns decide exceptions. In Bitcoin, sovereignty is distributed:
    - Anyone running a node can decide for themselves.
    - There’s no single gun, no central enforcer.
    - Programmers can fight over code, but code itself is rigid and indifferent.
- Does successful persuasion in Bitcoin (e.g., during upgrades or crises) make someone temporarily sovereign? Or is Bitcoin structured to resist any single sovereign?
- Bitcoin feels like a synthesis: programmatic law with no mercy, but distributed sovereignty that assumes humans are both good and bad.

### **Reflections**

- Is Bitcoin discovered or invented? Does it need a creation myth (Satoshi) to succeed?
- Faith in participation: running a node often requires trust in others’ expertise, which introduces an element of belief.
- Perhaps Bitcoin is best seen as a political system that distributes exception-making — sovereignty without a sovereign.
- Hot take: if everyone is sovereign, then no one is sovereign.
- Strong appreciation for the group dynamic — several noted this session as “the best part of the month.”

### **Closing Questions**

- How do we handle emergencies in Bitcoin without a sovereign?
- Is distributed sovereignty truly stable, or will crisis reveal hidden concentrations of power?
- Does Bitcoin challenge Schmitt’s entire framework by eliminating the need for a singular decision-maker?
